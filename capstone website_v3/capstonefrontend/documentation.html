The predicted PV generation is the average PV generation of the minute, 70 minutes before the predicted hour. Although the Arlington microgrid is only 500kW, future solar projects the PUD may implement may be greater than 3MW, for in which case the forecast must be given 70 minutes prior to the forecasting hour.</div>

                    <div class="model-name">Proportional Model</div>
                    <div class="model-description">The proportional forecasting model improves solar power prediction by comparing recent solar output to historical patterns and adjusting forecasts accordingly. It calculates the ratio between solar output 30 minutes before the forecast period on the same day (A) and 30 minutes before the forecast period on the previous day (B). If the ratio (A/B) is within an acceptable range (0.7 to 1.3), the model applies a proportional adjustment based on the ratio. If the ratio is outside the acceptable range, the model blends the current day's value (A) with the previous day’s value using a weighted approach (60% A and 40% previous day) for stability. To maintain consistency, the model holds the forecast constant within each 60-minute block.</div>

                    <div class="model-name">Trend Model</div>
                    <div class="model-description">The trend model uses the rate of change from 31 minutes to 30 minutes before the forecasting hour to generate a correction value. This value is multiplied by 30 and is added / subtracted to the 1-minute average from 31 minutes to 30 minutes before the forecasting hour. Correction is capped to 50kW in the summer months (June, July, August) when solar output is higher and more consistent, and 30kW the rest of the year to avoid over or under correction for extreme values.</div>

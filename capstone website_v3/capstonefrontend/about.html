            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>The Arlington microgrid project was developed to increase the power generation of the Snohomish County PUD at peak hours and includes a solar panel array and battery system. As a pilot project, the PUD is attempting to reduce the balancing reserve capacity burden placed on the Bonneville Power Authority (BPA). The BPA participates in the Energy Imbalance Market and wants to minimize their imbalance to limit costs and maximize profit from the market. To do this, the PUD needs to develop accurate predictions of PV generation by the solar panels and balance the actual PV generation using the battery, called capacity firming. The PUD currently uses the battery to absorb or inject power into the grid to adjust the power at a constant ramp rate when the PV generation fluctuates, called solar smoothing (Hitachi Method). When the predicted and actual PV generation differs, the BPA makes up the difference in power generation from reserves, but this incurs a cost on the PUD. Additionally, every cycle of the battery degrades the battery slightly, which can be associated with a cost. A successful project will limit the costs from the BPA while also preserving the battery’s life.</p>

                    <p>Andrew Arivett-Patton is the student project manager and has ensured that all deadlines and milestones for the capstone are met in a timely manner. They led the preparation of documents for industry mentors and the UW engine team, including the project plan, timelines, weekly reports, and assisted with developing weekly agendas and taking notes from capstone-related meetings. On the technical side, Andrew used Simulink to develop visual models of the various persistence methods developed by the team and developed a few models such as the averaged model and the switching model. They also developed a full battery pipeline with real battery characteristics in Simulink to measure battery throughput, prediction error, financial analysis, and battery health degradation for any solar dataset. Additionally, they contributed to many other small tasks throughout this project, such as determining if cloud cover contributed to the variation in the dataset, checking teammates model’s by implementing them in Simulink, and programming some models in the backend of the final website.

                    <p>Ivah Kaushansky is the student point of contact and has been responsible for all communication between students, faculty, and industry mentors. She has been responsible for preparing weekly agendas, taking capstone meeting notes, and sending them to the entire capstone team each week. Ivah has been programming in Matlab and Python to develop solar models. In Matlab, Ivah has been developing several models utilizing solar rate of change to predict future solar patterns: the “trend” model. She has researched and developed variations of the trend model to include trends from previous days and months, and incorporated sunrise time as well. Ivah also utilized her teammate’s Python battery pipelines to alter and incorporate into Matlab in order to test the validity of her models in development. In Python, Ivah created a preliminary machine learning model using XGBoost to create solar forecasts as well. Additionally, she has contributed to the website by implementing the back and frontend of the trend model, and has supported other website tasks as needed.
